run6/
Starting from run5/ parameters, change :saveat from 0.2 to 0.1. 
The total time is still 12. 
Objective: check on whether accuracy is affected by the number of saved points. 
Answer: the accuracy does not seem to be affected (eyeball norm, which is not the best approach)

In the future (run7/ and beyond), I will also increase the total time to 24, and increase the complexity of
the network in two ways: 
	1. increase the layer size from 32 to 64
	2. Leave the layer size at 32, but add an additional layer.
