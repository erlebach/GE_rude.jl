I fixed an error: protocol 1 was the only protocol, repeated 8 times. I fixed this. 
Convergence is better, but I believe it is a funciton of the number of points. 
Rerun by doubling the number of points. 

80 points per cycle, nb_cycles: 3
Still no mach on lower left corner. 
I will decrease time span even more and see if I get better results. s

One thought: I could getter results on longer time spans with either ddeper netowkrs or a network with more points per layer.
This suggests using a Neural ODE instead os layers? Does that even make sense?
