Set :T = 20 and :saveat=0.2 (similar to run4/ with :Ncycles=3 and :T approx 20), but add a new fully connected hidden layer to the neural network. 
In rude_impl.jl, the NN is now: 

    model_univ = FastChain(FastDense(dNN[:in_layer], hid, act),
                        FastDense(hid, hid, act),
                        FastDense(hid, hid, act),  # a second layer
                        FastDense(hid, dNN[:out_layer]))
	dct[:model_univ] = model_univ

Objective: We should see improvement over the results of run4/

Results
Surprisingly, there is no improvement over the results of run4/
