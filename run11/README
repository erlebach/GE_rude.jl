omega=20  (so I can see the effect of Nonlinearity (NL))
Layer: 32 points
1 hidden layer
Returned to tanh activation. 
:T = 12
:saveat = 0.01 (so I have 1200 points during the simulation time)
The simulation has now slowed down a lot. 

I hope that I'll get agreement between NN and protocol. 

Lower left plot is taking long time to converge. \omega=20 may be too high. 
The other components are doing well.

:saveat = 0.02, so there should be 600 points. However, there are far fewer plotted. 
I should plot out what is going on. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Convergence is much harder to come by. Not clear it will happen by the time of 1600 iterations. 

For larger omega, as the frequency increase,  one could decrease the time interval :T, and perhaps we'd get better
agreement with the actual solution. 

Note: What is Giesekus? That is not the correct solution, is it?  I AM CONFUSED. 

Final results are reasonable agreement between Giesekus and the NN model for omega=5.0
